Analysis output of the computational pipeline:
"SAM flag split read 1" = 0 indicates that the read is mapped to the positive strand of the transcriptome. 
"RNA 1 identity" refers to the identity of the RNA of the left of the chimera. 
"RNA 1 start position" refers to the start position to which the read is mapped along RNA 1. 
"RNA 1 end position" refers to the end position to which the read is mapped along RNA 1. 
"Mapping score split read 1" refers to the mapping score of the read that was mapped to RNA 1. 
"Cigar split read 1" indicates the number of bases that was clipped from the read "S" and the number of bases that was mapped to the read "M". 
"Split read 1" indicates the sequence that was mapped to RNA 1. The same nomenclature was used for the right side of the chimera, which is named as RNA 2.
